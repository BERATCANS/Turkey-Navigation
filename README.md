# Turkey-Navigation
This code creates an intercity navigation system.  
The user selects a route by specifying starting and destination points.  
Then, it calculates the distances between cities on the selected route and visualizes these distances.  
Additionally, it finds the shortest path using the Dijkstra algorithm and presents this path to the user.  
The code retrieves data from files containing city coordinates and distances between them, and provides the user with this information in a graphical interface.  
Using stdlib library it draws the path.
